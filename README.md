# Langchain-Retrievers

This repository provides a hands-on guide to working with **retrievers** in LangChain, an essential component of building intelligent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. It includes implementation examples, concise notes, and a reference video to support both learning and practical application.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Retrievers are responsible for **fetching relevant information** from a document store or knowledge base in response to a query. In LangChain, retrievers enable semantic search workflows by:

1. **Indexing Documents**: Organizing data in a way that facilitates efficient retrieval.
2. **Querying**: Using embeddings and similarity scores to find relevant documents.
3. **Integration with Chains**: Supplying relevant context to language models for more accurate and informative responses.

This approach is a cornerstone of systems that blend structured knowledge with LLM capabilities.

For a detailed understanding, refer to the [**Notes Retrievers in LangChain.pdf**](https://github.com/Harsh-Jindal-web/Langchain-Retrievers/blob/main/Notes%20Retrievers%20in%20LangChain.pdf) available in this repository.
